<p> Well, last semester was totally challenging for me because I have never experienced remote learning before and also learning from a far distance with a time difference of 13+ hours. I have faced various difficulties like Technical issues, Distractions and time management. But apart from that Computer Sciences, especially courses on programming languages, are not only more time consuming but are also difficult to grasp, which is due to the highly technical subject matter. Well before previous semester I was not able to work independently which means sometimes i feel alone to do my colloge work because I always like to work in classroom atmosphere which impacts on my concentration and grasping skills. If I talk about coding development issues then I would like to say that in the beggining whenever I wrote any code I always forget to recheck that and it always shows me an error so I had to find out the error which takes my double time after that I worked on it and I always try to recheck my coding portion after particular break which makes my work easier. I have also worked on recursion because it was also challenging but some youtube videos and faculty's guidelines helped me out. </p>

<p> Well as I mentioned above there were several difficulties which I had overcome but one of the I would like to talk about "comments" at such steps of coding because I always put less efforts to do comments which is not good but sometimes I'm out of words and a bit lazy to do at every step. But after I get know about that comments can do work like cherry on the cake means it makes your work more accurate. I try to put more efforts on it beacuse that increases readability of mine. Another point where I had improved was code checker, in the beggings sometimes I become overconfident and ignore to check the code in validator because I was assuming in my head that how can be that is wrong but after stumbling in that I'm aware and giving my best. Lastly, I'm talking about the thing in which I have improved the most is I was trying to mug-up codes before I write which turns out into headache after all I overcome this by understand every concept and taking help from my friend about this particular concern. </p>

<p> Well i have used several apps but here i would like to talk about Instagram because algorithm of instagram is designed to show you the content you’re most interested in. However, human behavior threw a wrench in the plan. The ease of scrolling Instagram makes it easy to forget to engage in accounts you’ve selected to follow. It includes interaction, engagement, searches and many more. In this social world people love to explore and surf on any platform where they get new information or the content they are interested in so for me instagram has the best algorithm because it connects the youth of the world by giving or taking knowledge through videos and posts.

 For the buttons I have would have changed the variable names in identifiers.
 (restartButton, undoButton and more). It will be more effective to start a variable with button in use. It would be helpful for the button by just typing "button_" so after this we have numerous options which are created.

<p> Well, I have used android and iOS both phones in my life. And There is always huge competition between android and iOS for comparing application's performances. So here I would like to talk about messages. According to me 'messages' app is more organized in apple because there are no buttons at bottom of the phone. I mean happening of mistakes will be less in iOS. However, in android there are minumum 3 buttons at bottom which are not necessary according to me if same thing can done with swipe gesture. One more benefit in apple messages is that in this user can see known senders as well as unknown senders which is very beneficial these days. But in android there is no specific option to see it. At the end its the user's choice some people never wanted to use apple product because they want freedom in surfing. Whereas, some apple user thinks its the best because it is the most secure as well as they prefer quality over quantity. </p>

I have go through this both website and I don't want to criticize any of them. But here I'm talking about apple developer technologies. I have found an ocean in it, I mean there is a number of things which can be done like access to beta builds of iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS and code-level support that gives developers access to an Apple developer who can help troubleshoot and streamline code. I like the most about this website is that it is very neat and perfectly organized for the user. As we can see, top bar of the site is pretty balanced and they have attached all the links in the alphabetical order which is absolutely easy for the user to explore what they need.
I found very interesting feature in it named business chat. It is a new way to communicate with Apple and other businesses using Messages.Do a chat to get answers to your questions, schedule appointments, resolve issues, make purchases, and more.
Increased efficiency: similar to other text-based chats, Apple Business Chat will allow agents to carry on multiple chats at once.
One of the key factor business chat is that it has joined the fray as the most direct engagement channel that offers “an interactive, personal way to connect with customers while respecting their privacy.
Reducing phone and email: given all the functionalities now encompassed by iMessage (e.g. Apple Pay), it is more likely customers can handle all support issues within the app. Over time, this will shift volume to iMessage and encourage users to contact companies through Apple Business Chat.

I have gone through this application and I have found many interesting things about it which integrates weight readings, daily activity levels, sleep, mindfulness check-ins, meals and meal quality, blood sugar, blood pressure, and more. The copy writing UX is one of the best feature in this app, user can easily respond others by just clicking appropriate options on the screen which can be impacted positive to the conversation. Another best feature is that they represents a body graph which includes everything related to user. This kind of UI in mobile can improve many things in human health issues. we need more implementation in mobile platform like this.

I have chose split 2 because it uses that given line. However the other split one depends on opening a file and also it has capability to reuse in input from the console. The primary advantage is that we can reuse itand also it becomes easier to decouple and for the components to be orthogonal.

 - The full-form MVC is (Model-View-Controller) where model works directly with the database. It is the model where all the application's data are stored. And view presents the model’s data to the customer/user on which they can perform some actions. Atlast controller is the most important part of the architecture. It is the decision-maker and exists between the view and the model.
  MVC allows developers to work on the components simultaneously. For example, a developer will be able to work on the view while another one will be able to work on the controller at the same time. This completes the project quicker than expected. However, the framework navigation can be complex because it introduces new layers of abstraction and hence it can be hard to understand. 
 - The full-form of MVP is (Model-View-presenter) where model continues to contain the data in a set of classes that describes the business logic and data. It also defines how the data can be changed and manipulated.And the view continues to implement the fragment classes but the area of what the view control changes. Atlast the presenter is handling UI updates based on changes to the data model, and also processes user inputs.
  MVP keeps the business logic and the persistence logic separate out of the Activity and Fragment classes. This enables the concerns are separated in a better way. However, an additional expectation to absorb information and experience and information has any kind of effect in the correct usage.
 - The full-form of MVVM is (Model-View-View-Model) The model is the actual data and/or information that the developers and designers deal with. It is referred to as the domain object. And the view is only thing the end user actually interacts with. The view takes certain liberties to make the data more presentable. The ViewModel is ideally a model for the View of the app. The ViewModel is a key component of the triad as it introduces Presentation Separation.
 - The app UI can be redesigned without touching the code, but the view has to be implemented entirely in XAML. Hence, a new version of the view should work with the existing view model but communication between various MVVM components and data binding can be exhausting.
 
 In conclusion both MVP and MVVM are derived from MVC. The main difference between MVC and its derivatives is the dependency that each layer has on other layers, as well as how tightly bound they are to each other.

 Well I have done lot of programming projects which includes global variables but here I would like to talk about GameRootAbstr.java. In this project there was lot of avoidable global values were used. Infact, I can take out static from them and make them private. However it contains only single abstract class which I can directly put into specific place.
